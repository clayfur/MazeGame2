# Maze Game 2

## About

A simple project in C++ created during my early days of Computer Science many years ago.

It is the second iteration of this idea and the files for the first have unfortunately been lost.

## How to play?

Use either WASD or arrow keys to move the player around.

Use Spacebar to interact with objects such as cannons and gate levers.

## Note

Since this code was written for an older MinGW based C++ compiler it no longer functions as expected.
