# Maze Game 2

## About

A simple project in C++ created during my early days of Computer Science many years ago.

It is the second iteration of this idea and the files for the first game created in C have unfortunately been lost.

The map was designed using simple formatting tricks in MS excel and imported directly into the code and edited to fit array assignements.

## How to play?

Use either WASD or arrow keys to move the player around.

Use Spacebar to interact with objects such as cannons and gate levers.

To exit use `/` and type exit.

## Note

Since this code was written for an older MinGW based C++ compiler it no longer functions as originally created.

If it works but odd characters appear try using older cmd like terminal with limited font capabiliies.
